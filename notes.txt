- bug: after pressed Nightlight intensity on SE layers, 
then pressing the same thing on SV layers activates the SE layer item

- is it better to make all layers as radio buttons and not be able to overlap 
each other?

- is it possible to memoize the heavy SV layers?

- fix the AWS instance reachability problem

- fix the peer dependency problems. (not possible to resolve the dependency tree)

- for GeoServer to be able to run through https (safe) network, it needs SSL certificate.
These certificate need to be purchased
