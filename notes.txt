What was done in the last 5 branches:
- Refactored sidebar component: made code much more understandable with some efficiency increase
- Debounced the range input element
- Made range input element not possible to go below 0 and above 100
- Refactored many other components and files: Map, BetterWMSTileLayer, reducerInitialState etc.
- Learnt how to establish Geoserver
- Created AWS ubuntu virtual machine to server Geoserver layers (stopped because of charges)
- Memoized SV layers: no network requests on opacity change
- It was impossible to install dependencies: fixed 
- Major refactoring - typescript migration
- Fixed problem with TypeScript not recognizing the .geojson file format

Plans: 
- Figure out how to transfer layers using http protocol
- If no funding: find free server for GeoServer. However, credit card input may still be required
- Potential: make layers with radio input elements instead of checkbox
- Make similar maps for other countries?
- Build back end server so that accounts could be created for people from different countries
- Add google traffic tracker?
