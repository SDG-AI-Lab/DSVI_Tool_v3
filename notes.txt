What was done in the last 5 branches:
- Refactored sidebar component: made code much more understandable with some efficiency increase
- Debounced the range input element
- Made range input element not possible to go below 0 and above 100
- Refactored many other components and files: Map, BetterWMSTileLayer, reducerInitialState etc.
- Learnt how to establish Geoserver
- Created AWS ubuntu virtual machine to server Geoserver layers (stopped because of charges)
- Memoized SV layers: no network requests on opacity change
- It was impossible to install dependencies: fixed 
- Major refactoring - typescript migration
- Fixed problem with TypeScript not recognizing the .geojson file format
- Serve high res layers over https

Plans:

- Adapt for multiple countries. 
    Files and variables that need dynamic change: 
    * file: SocioEconLegend.tsx, link in import statement
    * file: useMapFunctions.tsx, import of geojson at the top
    * file: reducerInitialState.tsx, map_settings.latlong 
    * file: reducer.ts, case 'CHANGE_MAP_SETTINGS' 
    * AOI geojson in AOIprojection.tsx

    Give access to certain country to different accounts:
    * Use country selection dropdown or option input elements 
    * Each account to have array of countries it has access to
    * Dropdown will show only countries indicated in this array

- Change Oblast to how each country calls it's regions
