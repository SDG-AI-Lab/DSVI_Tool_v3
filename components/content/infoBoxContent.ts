A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of classifying decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. The sub-sample size is controlled with the max_samples parameter if bootstrap=True (default), otherwise the whole dataset is used to build each tree.',

      p: 'Social Vulnerability (SV) is the capacity of individuals or communities to cope with social and environmental shocks (Adger 2000, Cutter 2003). This includes climate change, natural disasters, and other societal risks. Vulnerable groups have a disproportionate risk of being affected and experiencing more profound consequences, due to their socio-economic preconditions. SV assessments help to better map the connection between local conditions, social characteristics, or individual vulnerabilities and risks. The calculation of SV scores is a frequent practice to measure a communityâ€™s ability to respond to outside stressors and risks. It is an indirect way to quantify resilience. Having such an assessment helps to understand, get prepared and respond in a more effective manner, using a combination of the most appropriate tools once the risk materializes.',
